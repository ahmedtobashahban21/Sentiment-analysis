# Sentiment-analysis
Movies reviews
** IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews **
-download data from here ( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews )



for the first notebook 'IMDB_sentiment_analysis' :
in this notebook, I used the logistic Regression model and Naive Bayes 
in the second one "fine-tune LLM for sentiment analysis" :
we load Bert model from hugging face and fine tunning it with Pytorch 
** In each of them we need to preprocess the text data to get it clean 
for fine-tuning, we need a special format for input that taken into the model 
all steps are cleaned in the code 
thanks.
